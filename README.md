# Digital Learning Project

This project is the beginning of a full-stack project to assist with teaching the foundations of logic course at Boise State University.

Some lessons I learned from this project...
* I learned how to work with non-technical stakeholders. Turning someone's "dream" application into something tangible. 
* I learned that I was naive trying to accomplish this entire full-stack project on my own while working another job and a full-time student :')
* I learned how much I enjoy backend development. Sure I got Ionic framework up and running and made some cool flash cards, but all I wanted to do was tunnel on setting up a database, cybersecurity, and hosting it.
